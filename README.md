# I want to develop land and property - overview

Primarily for a design audience, to:

* introduce the service/products/project
* it's history / current phase
* link to the prototype(s) - behind accounts
* link to other sources of useful information - behind accounts


## User need

As a designer joining the project/service team I need to get up to speed with:

* context - why are we doing what we are doing now
* where is all the stuff i need to be immediately productive
* all the other stuff i may need, a bit less urgently than right now

## Principles

* be public by default, only protect information when necessary (marking when information is behind an account, who is allowed, and how to get access)
* provide a means of contact

## Content

### Content to include

* background to the service/product/project - perspective a designer needs
* how to contact people (but not names, email addresses, or any other personal information)

### Content to link to

* screenshots (in gallery.io)
* prototypes (do not include username/passwords)
* user research / needs
* other useful project/team information - to enable a designer to be productive on day 1
* contact details - for this app or the team
* you can link to information behind an organisational account

### Content to NOT publish in the open

* peoples names and other personal information
* usernames and passwords
* gov or organisational branding
* anything 'political', or contentious - think would I be prepared to say this openly on the internet



## To Do

* come up with a better name / description of what this app is
* consider other user needs - for example we believe this content to be useful outside of the design community

### Critique feeback (9th August 2019)

People giving feedback were new to Develop...

* Q: is the history useful? - Yes history is useful, both people read from the bottom up, feedback - would prefer to read from oldest to newest, especially with the AND sections.
* Q: should the history be expanded by default? - No, better to be able to skim the outline / get an overview of the phases
* Q: is the content in the history useful?  - Yes, but looking at the side content and thinking/discussing the phase content - it would be better to have a summary of design, User research, decisions, lessons learnt, etc grouped by phase.  So make each section/phase a summary of that phase - possibly links to a larger page about each phase
* New Idea - each time a new phase/section is added we should play it back to the design community - its a useful way of sharing whats going on and learning from each other
