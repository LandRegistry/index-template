# Introduction - what is the index?

Primarily for a design audience, to:

* introduce the service/products/project
* it's history / current phase
* link to the prototype(s) - behind accounts
* link to other sources of useful information - behind accounts


## User need

As a designer joining the project/service team I need to get up to speed with:

* context - why are we doing what we are doing now
* where is all the stuff i need to be immediately productive
* all the other stuff i may need, a bit less urgently than right now

## Principles

* be public by default, only protect information when necessary (marking when information is behind an account, who is allowed, and how to get access)
* provide a means of contact

## Content

### Content to include

* background to the service/product/project - perspective a designer needs
* how to contact people (but not names, email addresses, or any other personal information)

### Content to link to

* screenshots (in gallery.io)
* prototypes (do not include username/passwords)
* user research / needs
* other useful project/team information - to enable a designer to be productive on day 1
* contact details - for this app or the team
* you can link to information behind an organisational account

### Content to NOT publish in the open

* peoples names and other personal information
* usernames and passwords
* gov or organisational branding
* anything 'political', or contentious - think: would I be prepared to say this openly on the internet?



## To Do

* come up with a better name / description of what this app is
* consider other user needs - for example we believe this content to be useful outside of the design community
